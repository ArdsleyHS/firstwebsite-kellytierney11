    <title>Why are College Sports more interesting to watch than professional sports?</title>

  <h1>Professional athletes just don't play with the same intensity as college athletes</h1>
  <p>College athletes care more about hustle and heart to do whatever it takes to win as a team. For example in the NBA, they only care about high scoring games. However, college games have more defense and physical play, which is far more entertaining to watch than NBA players only wanting to score. </p>
